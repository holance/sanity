1. on OSX, CMAKE's FIND(DOWNLOAD) proved unreliable downloading opensll for some reason.

To workaround this, there is a function called sanity_download(...) which will try the internal
file(DOWNLOAD) function first, and then fall back to curl. If you see the same problem, make sure
you have installed curl (brew install curl)
