1. on OSX, CMAKE's FIND(DOWNLOAD) proved unreliable downloading opensll for some reason.

To workaround this, there is a function called sanity_download(...) which will try the internal
file(DOWNLOAD) function first, and then fall back to curl. If you see the same problem, make sure
you have installed curl (brew install curl)

2. FEDORA 23 - you need to install makedepend

4. MacOSX needs command line tools:
	xcode-select --install

3. MacOSX as a host : you will need the following tools to configure protobuf:
	homebrew

	brew install curl libtool autoconf automake
